			We are a group of second-year Computer Engineering students who have put our ideas and knowledge in common with the intention of creating a business. So we have created Farm Monitor an app/web with which you can control your crops from a distance. This application would be divided into sections with information on products, crop status, weather reports and market prices, all of them in real time. You could also control the irrigation and the amount of light that the crops receive.
